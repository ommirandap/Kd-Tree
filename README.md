Implementation of a Kd-Tree on Internal &amp; External Memory

### Description
The Nearest Neighbour problem, is `Given a set of P points and a given query point q, find the point p in P closest to q`
To resolve this problem **quickly**, a known approach is to implement a Kd-Tree, in order to maintain some sort of organization of the points.

### Methodology
- [ ] Implement the Kd-Tree
	- Build
	- NN Queries
- [ ] Implement the analysis instance (for internal memory)
- [ ] Run the experiments for internal memory
- [ ] Implement the analysis instance (for external memory)
- [ ] Run the experiments for external memory
